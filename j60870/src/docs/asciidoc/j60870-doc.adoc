== Intro

j60870 is an implementation of the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol standard
for client (i.e. master or controlling station) and server (i.e. slave
or controlled station) applications.

You can use j60870 to program your individual client or server
applications. A simple console client is part of the library. You can
execute it using the scripts found in the folder "run-scripts".

== Distribution

After extracting the distribution tar file the j60870 library can be
found in the folder /build/libs.

== Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is by taking a look at the code of the
console client and the sample server which can be found here:
src/main/java/org/openmuc/j60870/app/ . These applications in
combination with the javadoc should satisfy most of your documentation
needs.

Here is a short summary of the steps to get a client running:

* Create and configure an instance of ClientConnectionBuilder.

* Connect to the server using ClientConnectionBuilder.connect() which
  returns the connection. The client is now connected to the server
  via TCP/IP.

* Initialize the data transfer by calling
  Connection.startDataTransfer.

* Now all incoming ASDUs (except for confirmation messages) will be
  forwarded to the ASduListener you registered. Every ASDU contains a
  number of Information Objects. The information objects contain
  information elements that make up the actual data. You will have to
  cast the InformationElements of the ASDU to a concrete
  implementation in order to access the data inside them. Every
  standardized Information Element is implemented by a class starting
  with the letters "Ie". The Type Identifier allows you to figure what
  to cast a particular Information Element to.

* You can use the Connection instance to send commands.


== Terminology

* *OA* - Originator Address 

* *Monitor direction* - direction from server to client

* *Control direction* - direction from client to server

* *CON* - confirmation message

* *COT* - Cause of transmission

* *STARTDT ACT* - Start data tranfer message. Needs to be sent by the
   client before information messages may be exchanged between client
   and server.

== Develop j60870

We use the Gradle build automation tool. The distribution contains a
fully functional gradle build file ("build.gradle"). Thus if you
changed code and want to rebuild a library you can do it easily with
Gradle. Also if you want to import our software into Eclipse you can
easily create Eclipse project files using Gradle. Just follow the
instructions on our FAQ site:
